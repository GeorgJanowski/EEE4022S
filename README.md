Code used in 4th year thesis project.

This project explored using generative networks to degrade road markings in autonomous driving datasets.

- image processing scrips: used to create training examples of degraded road markings.
- colab notebooks: used to train an implementation of the Pix2Pix GAN to perform road marking degradation.
