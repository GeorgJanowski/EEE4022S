Colab notebooks used to train and test the road marking degradation networks using the Pix2Pix GAN.
Training data and trained models are stored in Google Drive.

- pix2pix_params: Used to see the effects of changing some parameters.
- pix2pix_512_net: Uses a 512x512 network architecture instead of a 256x256 one.
- pix2pix_512_size: Uses 512x512 images with a 256x256 network architecture.
- get_results: Processes test images with multiple networks to get experiment results.
